# Tri-Material-Gate-Silicon-on-Nothing-Junction-less-MOSFET-for-Low-Power-MixedSignal-Circuits
ðŸš€Designed and simulated a Tri-Material Gate Silicon-on-Nothing Junction-less MOSFET using TCAD tools to improve electrostatic control, reduce leakage current, and lower power consumption, making it suitable for next-generation low-power mixed-signal circuits.
